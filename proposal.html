     <ul>
         A: The objective of my page would be to inform people about the interworkings of competitive rock-climbing and why it is so interesting and worth watching.
         Sport climbing was recently added to the Olympics, and as new people are starting to get more involved in the sport,
         I think it would be beneficial to have a page explaining the rules and history of competitive climbing for new viewers.

            (likely due to the Olympics) and want to know more about the sport.
